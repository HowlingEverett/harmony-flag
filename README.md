# Harmony Flag

Throw off the chains of Ecmascript 5, and start learning Ecmascript 6 (otherwise known as Javascript Harmony) today! Harmony Flag lets you learn and try Ecmascript 6 right here in its native environment, the browser. Get your head around Classes, Modules, Generators, and block scopes, and try them out with real-world examples to help you understand just why these features are awesome.

Harmony Flag is built on the excellent Traceur compiler, which means when you've finished learning about all these magical-awesome features you can `npm install -g traceur' and start using Ecmascript 6 in your own applications. See the 'setting up an Ecmascript 6 development environment' page for examples on how to configure Traceur with Gulp.js, this year's cool tool for automation.
